To start game, run main and close out of the rules game will start, and then press space to play.

I was unable to fully complete my game as I would have liked, I had problems with my score tracking, and I wanted to increase the score by every enemy troop destroyed.
Because I was unable to get the score, I did not display the correct score.

For my character image, I was unable to find one that would not display the full background of the picture, even with a transparent .png

Game does run and plays but is not my desired product.

-Thanks
